transactions: Bitcoin for Humans
================================
``transactions`` is a small python library to easily create and push
transactions to the bitcoin network.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install transactions


Examples
--------
Assuming the following cast of characters:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> alice = 'mhyCaF2HFk7CVwKmyQ8TahgVdjnHSr1pTv'
    >>> bob = 'mqXz83H4LCxjf2ie8hYNsTRByvtfV43Pa7'
    >>> carol = 'mtWg6ccLiZWw2Et7E5UqmHsYgrAi5wqiov'

Moving ``10000`` satoshis from ``alice`` to ``bob``:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from transactions import Transactions
    >>> transactions = Transactions(testnet=True)
    >>> tx = transactions.create(alice, (bob, 10000))
    >>> tx_signed = transactions.sign(tx, 'alice master secret')
    >>> transactions.push(tx_signed)

Moving ``600`` satoshis from ``bob`` to ``carol`` with a custom ``op_return``:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> tx = transactions.create(bob, (carol, 600), op_return='HELLOFROMASCRIBE')
    >>> tx_signed = transactions.sign(tx, 'bob master secret')
    >>> transactions.push(tx_signed)

With ``transactions`` all amounts are in satoshi and we currently only support
`BIP32`_ wallets (hierarchical deterministic wallets, aka "HD Wallets").
